- Run sample HD122563 MIKE spectrum all the way through LESSPayne with a few lines.
  1. PayneEchelle (+ figures, check they're made)
  2. Normalization (+ figures, check they're made)
  3. EQW (+ figures)
  4. Stellar parameters (+ figures)
     Automatic from PayneEchelle
     Automatic from balancing Fe EQW
  5. Synthesis (+ figures?)
  6. Resynth (+ figures?)
  7. Error script calculation
  8. Summary (+ figures?)
- Given a directory of reduced MIKE data:
    Create config files
    Run PayneEchelle on all config files
    Get the PayneEchelle summary file
- Load a saved SMH file into the GUI
    It will be too much trouble to test that the GUI works...
    But I should at least document what can be done at each step.
