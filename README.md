VERSION NOTE:
- v0.1 is the current stable version. Things are working and it is being used for papers.
- v0.2 is the active development version.

If you are new to SMH, you should use v0.2, because the underlying data format has changed significantly.
Files are not backwards compatible, but there is a script to convert old save files into new save files.
